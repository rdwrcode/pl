# Ruby- continued

## OOP vs FP decomposition
expressions, 
different variants of expressions/constructors (data),
different operations to perform on the data

| operations | eval | toString | hasZero | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Int |? | ? | ? | ? |
| Add |? | ? | ? | ? |
| Negate |? | ? | ? | ? |

one function per column: FP : interpreter, smaller functions
one class per row: OOP : GUI, different classes

## adding operations or variants

## binary methods with functional decomposition

## double dispatch

## multiple inheritance

## mixins

## interfaces

## abstract methods
